We firmly believe that a university should be more than just studying. It should be a place that gives you the opportunity to have practical hands-on experience. This helps students achieve higher standards and to gain an all around knowledge of their scope of study. We know UNT has lots of opportunities laying around for students but there is no solid solution as to where students can learn about these opportunities. So we want to create an effective solution for this issue. We want to connect students with faculty members, departments, employers or even other students.

As a solution, we thought of creating a website which will be a central hub where people post their ideas or projects. So the students can browse through this pool of ideas/projects and pick something that interests them. We are also interested in delivering a great experience to both parties so we thought of creating student profiles where they have an allocated space to describe skills, experience, previous work and anything they carry under their belt. By having these profiles students will be able expose themselves to potential clients who may run search queries to find skillful individuals. 

We hope that this will help a lot of students gain practical experience and exposure. As a team, we are working hard to deliver a great product and committed to reach our goals in the best way possible.
